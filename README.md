# economic vs financial health?
Basically, economic health optimizes on personal subjective value, involving non-financial inputs and outputs.

Economics is both a quantitative approach to sociology and also a study of the optimal allocation of resources. Basically, a good economic health app can help you understand what you should be doing at any time. Like a life coach.

1. A basic example is taking a vacation. It's expensive and will never be selected as an optimal investment using purely financial investing strategies.
2. Other examples would be: Eat more expensive health food to improve your health. The return is non-financial and only very indirectly might relate to long term income gains. Most budgeting systems would treat this as a pure expense. An economic health app can proactively select increased health spending as an optimal economic investment.
3. Time is forefront in importance in an economic health app. Budgets tell you what to do with your money, and cutting-edge ones might have a calender integration that tells you when a bill is due. Economics take this trend 10 years into the future. Every hour has an opportunity cost. You could be sleeping, studying, working out, or doing something else. How do you compare all of these options? You can use your own judgement and intuition, but an economic health app assist your judgement and intuition to compare these things in a low-bias, high-precision way.
4. Economic health apps also prioritize behavioral considerations. We see a little of this in behavioral finance, but it rarely makes it's way into financial planning. Dave Ramsey's snowball justification (motivation from small wins) is a rare example of this kind of thing, but it's still not very tailored. Ideally, economic health strategies are adapted to your specific personality.
5. Economic health apps are personalized far more than traditional investing and budgeting. In traditional investing you consider risk tolerance, and in sophisticated investment you consider some basic forms of time preference such as target retirement date. In economic health apps we also care about other stuff like health preference, stress tolerance, vicarious utility (I don't value my health but my wife would be mad if I died so I vicariously value it), even religious values! After all, what you should be doing is fundamentally a moral question no?
